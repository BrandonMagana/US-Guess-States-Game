# US-Guess-States-Game
Created a game for learning the US states using pandas and turtle graphics module.

The Game will be asking you for the name of the 50 US States, this is going to be display with a Screen that keeps on asking you States names until you type "Exit" or you guessed all the names.

After the game finished, the turtle screen window will be shut down and the scrytp will generate a .csv file with the states you couldn't guessed.
